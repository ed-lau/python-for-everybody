3.3 Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.

python
number = raw_input("Enter number:")

try:
    number = float(number)
except:
    number = -1

if number >= 0.9:
    print "A"
elif number >= 0.8:
    print "B"
elif number >= 0.7:
    print "C"
elif number >= 0.6:
    print "D"
elif number < 0.6:
    print "F"
else:
    print "Error!"
    quit()
